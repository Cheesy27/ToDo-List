# To-Do List Application Documentation

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list-app.git
   cd todo-list-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
npm install
```

3. **run the development server**:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.



## Overview
The To-Do List Application is a personal project built using Next.js, React.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. It showcases front-end development skills with an emphasis on efficient rendering, state management, and user-friendly design. This project highlights declarative programming, side effects handling, and the creation of a dynamic single-page application (SPA) with modern front-end technologies.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Utilized Tailwind CSS for a clean and modern interface that works across devices and screen sizes.
- **Next.js for Efficient Rendering**: Implemented server-side rendering and routing for faster page loads and better SEO.
- **React.js Principles**: Built using components, props, and state management, ensuring a dynamic user experience.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Maintained consistent state across components to prevent issues like state pollution.
- **TypeScript for Type Safety**: Applied TypeScript to enhance code reliability and scalability.
- **Interactivity and Callbacks**: Used callbacks and side effects handling to manage user input effectively.

## Steps Taken
1. **Setup the Project**:
   - **Initialized** a new Next.js project using `npx create-next-app@latest my-todo-app` and navigated to the directory.
   - **Installed Tailwind CSS**: Configured Tailwind by installing `tailwindcss`, setting up `tailwind.config.js`, and `postcss.config.js`.

2. **Build the User Interface**:
   - **Created reusable components** for the to-do list item, input form, and header using React.js.
   - **Styled with Tailwind CSS** to ensure a modern and responsive look.

3. **Implement Functionality**:
   - **Managed state** with React hooks, allowing users to add, update, and delete tasks in the to-do list.
   - **Handled user interactions** using callbacks and managed side effects with `useEffect` hooks.

4. **Testing and Code Quality**:
   - **Used TypeScript** for type safety, preventing common errors.
   - **Conducted code reviews** to maintain clean, consistent, and maintainable code.

5. **Deployment**:
   - **Deployed** the application to Vercel, which integrates seamlessly with Next.js for easy scaling and accessibility.

## Key Highlights
- **Declarative Programming**: Kept the code clean and simplified logic through declarative techniques.
- **Type Safety with TypeScript**: Enhanced code reliability by catching errors early in development.
- **Full-Stack Integration**: Used Next.js for server-side rendering and React.js for dynamic front-end development.
